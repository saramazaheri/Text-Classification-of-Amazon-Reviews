In this assignment, I present a sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews using three classification
models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Na√Øve Bayes. The goal is to
classify reviews into their respective star ratings (1-5). The study explores different preprocessing
techniques, feature extraction methods, and model optimizations.
